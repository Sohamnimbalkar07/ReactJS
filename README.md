# ReactJS Learning Journey

## Overview

Welcome to my **ReactJS Learning Repository**! This repository showcases a series of **mini-projects** and **demos** that I built while learning ReactJS. Each project is a self-contained example that illustrates key React concepts and tools. All projects were initialized with **Create React App** to provide a standardized development setup. The content spans core **React features** like **components**, **props**, **state**, and **hooks**, along with popular libraries and patterns such as **React Router** for routing and **Redux** for global state management.

## Topics Covered

- **Functional Components & JSX**: Building UI with **modular**, **reusable functional components** and using **JSX** syntax to render elements.
  
- **Props & State**: Passing data via **props** to child components, and managing local component **state** using the `useState` hook.
  
- **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`): Utilizing `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for handling side effects like **data fetching** and lifecycle events.

- **Client-Side Routing**: Implementing **navigation** and multiple views using **React Router** (e.g., `<Routes>`, `<Link>` components) to create single-page applications with dynamic routing.

- **Data Fetching (Axios)**: Performing **HTTP requests** to external APIs using **Axios** within React components, often inside `useEffect` to fetch data asynchronously.

- **Array & List Rendering**: Dynamically rendering lists of data with **JavaScript array methods** (like `map`) and Reactâ€™s **key** prop to efficiently update the UI.

- **Development Tools**: Using **Create React App** for project scaffolding, and leveraging **npm scripts** (e.g., development server, build, etc.) for an optimized development workflow.
